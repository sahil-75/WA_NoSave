# WA_NoSave

## The Problem 
Ever been in a situation when you need to send a stranger - a store owner, cab driver, a friend of a friend of a friend (the one who's Netflix we all have been using :P), a text/picture/contact and you are forced to save their number, in order to sync their contact with WhatsApp? We might even not feel the need to have our profile pictures/status visible to these one-time-use contacts, but are left with no choice but to save their contacts.

## The Solution
**WA_NoSave** is the one-stop solution to the age-old problem (well, it's been ages since we're using WhatsApp now). With **WA_NoSave**, you can directly message any person on WhatsApp without having to save their numbers.

## The Problem in the Solution

### Why install another app, which will consume space, when I can simply save and delete their numbers once my work is done?

 - Strictly speaking from a privacy perspective, we should never save numbers of strangers because a lot of applications sync our contacts details, i.e., assume everyone in your contact list is a friend and may end up sharing details with them, which you might not be willing to share.

 - Also, a lot of times, we end up forgetting to delete their numbers and try to figure out later who this person was and what was the purpose of storing their numbers. Hence not deleting the contact, thinking it might be uselful.

 - Also, the app is only kb in size, so you don't need to worry about the space issue, which apparently we all have even after buying the model with the max storage (Only god knows where all the free space goes!)
